## Criteria Description
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule: WHEN I open the planner, THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. WHEN I scroll down, THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours. WHEN I view the time blocks for that day, THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. WHEN I click into a time block, THEN I can enter an event. WHEN I click the save button for that time block, THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage. WHEN I refresh the page, THEN the saved events persist.
